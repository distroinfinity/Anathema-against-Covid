## Inspiration
The inspiration to make this project emerged when last year in December me and my entire family were  tested positive for the novel Corona Virus. I wanted to build something that would make people more aware about present Covid situation around them. So they can plan their workflow and travelling decision accordingly.
## What it does
The project displays map of your country(currently India) in AR and showcases the state wise distribution of the number of people affected with the virus. It also displays the total number of confirmed, recovered and deaths in your country as well as in different states in a very interactive way.
## How we built it
We built the project Unity 2019.4.21f1 game engine and ARFoundation package. To get the Covid data for a country and different states in it, we are calling this API [Covid-API](https://github.com/covid19india/api). So we would also like to thank the people who made this public record.
## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges that we ran into was to make the placard which are currently displaying the confirmed, recovered and deaths, interactive. The placard had to respond as the user moves their phone's camera.
Another challenge was to animate the bar graph as per the Covid data over a period of time.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud of the fact that with the help of our product we will be able to help people fight against Covid-19. Also I am proud of my entire team who did their respective parts on schedule and up to the mark.
## What we learned
Our scripting skills with Unity were polished during the development of this project as the project had some complex C# scripts.
## What's next for Anathema against Covid-19
We want to expand our project to cover the entire world map. Also improve on UI/UX part of the project.
